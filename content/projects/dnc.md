Be a Dot! Be a Circle!&nbsp;Be anything you want, just avoid what you are not! 

[Dots and Circles](https://momodevelop.itch.io/dots-and-circles) is an experimental Bullet Hell game that uses mouse as movement. Collect as many bullets as you can to see how much you can score!

- Move around with the mouse
- **Left click** to change between being a Dot or a Circle.

This game and its engine is written from scratch with the 'handmade' philosophy. Almost everything is coded from ground up in C/C++ for reasons mostly educational. The only code not written by me are therenderer APIs, OS APIs, a couple of stb and standard&nbsp;library headers.&nbsp;
