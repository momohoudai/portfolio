Karu's Dream is a game prototype written in C++17 using SDL2 with the EnTT library. It is a game where you play as Karu, trapped in a nightmare, a nightmare where he can only move left and right, and jump; he cannot stop. Monsters will appear from the sides to eat him and touching them is fatal. Equipped with only a sword, try to defeat as many monsters as possible!

The motivation of this project is to explore modern C++ features, the SDL2 library and coding a game using the Entity-Component-System paradigm. Everything else is coded from scratch.
