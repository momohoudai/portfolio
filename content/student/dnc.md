**Dots n' Circles** is a 2D Projectile Dodging/Collecting Game Hybrid. The player will control the character movement (Morphing One) with their mouse. The Morphing One has two forms - Dot forms and Circle forms, which players can switch using the left mouse button. Collect as many projectiles with the same form as the Morphing One! But beware, projectiles of the opposite form will harm you!
                
This game is a GAM100 student project written by a team of 2 for DigiPen Institute of Technology, Singapore. It is coded using DigiPen's inhouse ProjectFUN engine for Window, with C/C++ as its main scripting language.
