**The Gods Love Me** is a running game for the Android platform. Players have to interact with the environment and enemies to guide Kung Pao to safety on this simple 2D game!
              
This game is a GAM400 student project written by a team of 3 for DigiPen Institute of Technology, Singapore. It is coded in Java with LibGDX and Box2D for Android devices, in an attempt to explore the mobile market which was very new at the time this was created.

My responsibilities include:
* Project management; determined direction, flow and objectives.
* Implemented physics and collision systems around Box2D
* Implemented tutorial system
* Code documentation

The game is currently unavaliable online, until I get my hands on the APK some day :)
