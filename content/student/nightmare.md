**Nightmare** is an Action Adventure game where the player have to save Tandy from her nightmare. Use your mouse to sprinkle fairy dust on the swarming monsters! Banish them from the dream world as Tandy tries to find a way out of this nightmare!
              
The game is a GAM300/350 student project written by a team of 7 for DigiPen Institute of Technology, Singapore. It is mostly coded from ground up in C/C++ for Windows, with only DirectX and FMOD libraries used.
           
As the lead game designer, my responsibilities include: 
* Implemented all gameplay-related code such as object interactions, level transition, triggers, enemies and events.
* Determined the direction, flow and objectives of the game.
* Ensured healthy communication between engineers and artists.

Nightmare is currently avaliable at DigiPen Arcade [here](https://arcade.digipen.edu/games/nightmare).
