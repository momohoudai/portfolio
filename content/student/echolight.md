**Echolight** is a real-time puzzle game! Create circuits using special bumpers to touch the stars, which will light up the dark and lonely world in this inventive puzzle game.
   
This game is a GAM200/250 student project written by a team of 4 for DigiPen Institute of Technology, Singapore. It is mostly coded from ground up in C/C++ for Windows. Only DirectX and FMOD libraries were used.
              
My responsibilities as a Tech Lead include:
* Writing the physics and collision systems, including spatial partitioning
* Implementing menus and UI systems
* Implementing tutorial system
* Code documentation 

The game is avaliable at DigiPen arcade [here](https://arcade.digipen.edu/games/echolight).
