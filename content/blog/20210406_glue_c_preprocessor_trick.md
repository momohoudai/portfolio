Macro tricks are rare to find nowadays. Sometimes, I would code and _know_ of a trick but had forgotten how to go about implementing it because they can look as arcane as Template Metaprogramming. Hopefully, I can document some of my knowledge of these tricks in this blog. Here, I will introduce what I call the 'Glue' macro trick. 

<!--more-->

Let's start with a problem. I'll use a simple example from my project. Suppose I have a simple struct that represents a string, and provide a simple function that acts as a constructor:



```cpp
struct string {
    unsigned Count;
    char *Buffer;
};

string CreateString(char* Buffer, unsigned Count) {
    string Ret = {};
    Ret.Buffer = Buffer;
    Ret.Count = Count;
}
```
And the way to easily initialize such a struct might be something like this:

```cpp
char tempBuffer[256] = {};
string Str = CreateString(tempBuffer, 256);
```

It's terribly unwieldy. We might end up in an ugly scenario where it looks like this:
```cpp
char tempBuffer1[256] = {};
string Str1 = CreateString(tempBuffer1, 256);

char tempBuffer2[128] = {};
string Str2 = CreateString(tempBuffer2, 128);

char tempBuffer3[64] = {};
string Str3 = CreateString(tempBuffer3, 64);

char tempBuffer4[32] = {};
string Str4 = CreateString(tempBuffer4, 32);
```
But we see some hope! There is a pattern in the code so we decide to use macro concatenation to help us make the code look cleaner. We hope to achieve something like below which will expand to the code above:

```cpp
CreateStackString(Str1, 256);
CreateStackString(Str2, 128);
CreateStackString(Str3, 64);
CreateStackString(Str4, 32);
```

So now, we will try to implement the macro. We start off naively by trying to define a macro based on what we want to substitute.

```cpp
 #define CreateStackString(Name, Num) \ char tempBuffer[Num] = {}; \ string Name = CreateString(tempBuffer, Num)
```

This would be good for one call, but subsequent calls would cause an error because `tempBuffer` would be redefined. What we kind of want is some kind of unique id to attach to `tempBuffer`. A common way is to use the `__LINE__` macro definition that will evaluate to the document's line number. It might not work for all cases, but for this case, it is good enough because it's impossible to have two `tempBuffers` exist in the same line AND scope.

So we just concatenate `__LINE__` to `tempBuffer`. Simple right?

```cpp
 #define CreateStackString(Name, Num) char tempBuffer##__LINE__[Num] = {}; string Name = CreateString(tempBuffer##__LINE__, Num)
```
Sadly, this does not work. According to be C99 specification in section 6.10.3.3, line 2:

`If, in the replacement list of a function-like macro, a parameter is immediately precededor followed by a ## preprocessing token, the parameter is replaced by the corresponding argumentâ€™s preprocessing token sequence;  however, if an argument consists of no preprocessing tokens, the parameter is replaced by a placemarker preprocessing token instead.`

That means that when `##` is encountered, any macros on the left and right of it will not be evaluated. That means that this:

```cpp
 CreateStackString(Str1, 256);
```

Would evaluate to something like this:

```cpp
 char tempBuffer__LINE__[256] = {}; string Name = CreateString(tempBuffer__LINE__, 256)
```

Which means that we are back to square one. To solve this, a simple indirection trick can be used to **force** the `__LINE__` macro to evaluate (and by extension, any macro you want to evaluate that is part of an argument for the macro concatenation `##` syntax).

```cpp
#define glue_(a,b) a##b
#define glue(a,b) glue_(a,b)
```

Then we use the `glue` macro like this to solve our problem:

```cpp
 #define CreateStackString(Name, Num) char glue(tempBuffer,__LINE__)[Num] = {}; string Name = CreateString(glue(tempBuffer,__LINE__), Num)
```

For clarity, the macro expansion is as follows:
```cpp
CreateStackString(Str1, 256);
CreateStackString(Str2, 128);
CreateStackString(Str3, 64);
```

expands to:

```cpp
// Expand 1
char glue(tempBuffer,__LINE__)[256] = {}; string Str1 = CreateString(glue(tempBuffer,__LINE__), 256);
char glue(tempBuffer,__LINE__)[128] = {}; string Str2 = CreateString(glue(tempBuffer,__LINE__), 128)
char glue(tempBuffer,__LINE__)[64] = {}; string Str3 = CreateString(glue(tempBuffer,__LINE__), 64)
```

expands to:

```cpp
char glue_(tempBuffer,1)[256] = {}; string Str1 = CreateString(glue(tempBuffer,1), 256);
char glue_(tempBuffer,2)[128] = {}; string Str2 = CreateString(glue(tempBuffer,2), 128);
char glue_(tempBuffer,3)[64] = {}; string Str3 = CreateString(glue(tempBuffer,3), 64);
```

which will finally expand to:

```cpp
char tempBuffer1[256] = {}; string Str1 = CreateString(tempBuffer1, 256);
char tempBuffer2[128] = {}; string Str2 = CreateString(tempBuffer2, 128);
char tempBuffer3[64] = {}; string Str3 = CreateString(tempBuffer3, 64);
```

The trick is, in the end, not very complicated. It is just to get around the rather unintuitive specification in the C99 standard that states that arguments for `##` would not be evaluated.
