Felt like I played really well, but didn't have any form of infinite scaling. 
Almost beat the heart but ultimately did not. Might need to think about how to get infnite scaling...

Okay act 1. Act 2 somehow got Corruption +  Dead Branch + Runic Pyramid. Super drunk with power.
Always take Corruption though. Using it on non-defend skill cards is somehow ridiculous. 
This is also the first time I tied Sever Soul, which I thought is a dead card. It is less dead than I expected.

# #5 | 20230930 | Ironclad | A0 | Around act 2

Took pandora's box and suddenly I have zero defends. Played extremely poorly in Act 1 overall. 

Lesson learnt: Don't Pandora Box all your defends away.

This is a Runic Pyramid run. The deck size ended up a bit big, but we had 2 Offerings and 1 Battle Trance, allowing us to quickly get Demon Form. Getting Uppercut at the last minute was quite clutch to remove the artifact buffs on the last few bosses. After this run, I'm pretty sure I rank Runic Pyramid above most energy giving relics.

Act 1: Took Hemokinesis early to see its strength. Took Blood for Blood. Bought Pocket Watch. Damage and card cycle was so high we beat Slime boss in like 2 turns.

Act 2: Lack of AOE and block made me hestitate going for elite and boss fight but they somehow turned out well. Deck so far has no 'exhaust other cards'.  Was given Offering, Corruption, Immolate. Took Offering because I had 4 powers. Was afraid to get Immolate because I don't have any exhaust card. Mistake?

Act 3: Surprising didn't lose to any elite. Was offered Second Wind many times but didn't pick it...

Died at heart. Not enough block. Maybe I should've taken True Grit Or Second Wind when offered?

# #2 | 20230917 | Ironclad | A0 | F57 

Received Omamori early, which turns out to block Necronomicon curse at Act 2, which is huge. 

Had relics that give block at turns 1,2,3. Barricade was taken (deck can reliably block alot) then Velvet Choker (thinking that deck needed more energy to scale faster especially with Barricade). Eventually found Entrench. Went for tons of draw.

Raptomancer almost owned me at Act 3 because I have no AOE.

Necronomicon is actually insane

# #1 | 20230917 | Ironclad | A0 | F54 

Corruption/Dark Embrace with lots of Anger.

Died at twins. Felt like I didn't have enough ways to accelerate into win cons. Twin fight feels like you need to get your wincon by turn 2-ish. 

Deck was otherwise okay and have no problems with Act 3 even when Velvet Choker was in the way.


# Ironclad Cards

## Core 

Dark Embrace
* Basically makes exhaust cards draw.

Corruption
* Steamrolls hallway fights. 
* Dead card against longer boss fights but still...

Bloodletting 
* Basically free energy

Exhume
* Very strong because Ironclad has alot of 'do big thing but exhaust' cards.

Impervious
* Way better than it looks. Usually a lifesaver. 

Power Through
* It's like Impervious on crack especially if you have a way to exhaust Wounds 

Feel The Pain
* Always take. Laughs at daze cards. Synergizes too well with exhaust cards

Offering
* Incredible acceleration card
* Remember that it's not a good 'consistant card draw' card, so take other card draws with it.

Hemokinesis
* Synergies with Blood for Blood and Rapture, which are strong cards. 

Blood for blood
* Potentially free big damage. Makes cards like Hemokinesis and Offering more reasonable.


## Always good to have 

Flame Barrier
* Always nice to have 1 upgraded 

Disarm
* Very good against multi attackers. 
* Can be stupid with Exhume loop

Armaments
* Potentially saves upgrades and skew decisions towards upgrading powers...which potentially leads to having a good reason to take more powers?

Wounded Strike
* Wounds are fake.

Rage
* Block!

Seeing Red
* Free energy kinda.


## Sometimes helpful 

Metalicise
* Decent. Surprised how many times it edges out a blocking round.

Inflame
* Decent. Stronger with multihit cards already in deck.

Spot Weakness
* Decent. Stronger with multihit cards already in deck.

Double Tap
* It's strong only when you have lots of acceleration, card draw, energy and a good card to use with. 
* Note that it can do Whirlwind twice, which is insane.

Brutality
* Not bad. Might want to take if desperate or if there are too many cards in hand?

Sever Soul
* Better than you think. Just be careful not to exhaust too many blocks away.

## Very situational

Rampage

Berzerk
* 

Body Slam
* Only when you have block. Otherwise sus.


## Almost never

Rapture
* Jorbs ranks this really low. Maybe because there are not enough cards that activate it? That would make sense.
