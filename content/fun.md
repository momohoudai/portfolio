## What is this
This is personal list of links I use for inspiration and gamedev which I have personally evaluated and deemed useful or interesting. Thus, a lot of these drive how I work, program and think.

## Streams/Videos for inspiration
- [Handmade Hero](https://hero.handmade.network/episode/code): Stream that captures win32 low-level game engine development from scratch with minimal libraries used.
- [Jonathan Blow](https://https://www.twitch.tv/j_blow/): Stream of the creator of Braid, The Witness and the JAI programming language
- [Chinnykian](https://www.twitch.tv/chinykian): Singaporean indie game developer  
- [momohoudai](https://www.twitch.tv/momohoudai): My stream
- [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-y-6csu5WGm29I7JiwpnA): Generally good videos on anything computers
- [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile): Generally good videos on anything math

## Tools
- [Compiler explorer](https://godbolt.org/): Useful to debunk any "this code runs faster" thoughts in your head.
- [4Coder](https://4coder.handmade.network/): My favorite text editor, customizable in C/C++ to my needs
- [Milton](https://milton.handmade.network/): Lightweight painting program for sketching
- [LibreSprite](https://libresprite.github.io/): Free version of 'Aesprite', a pixel drawing and animation tool
