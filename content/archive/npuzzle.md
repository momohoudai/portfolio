This small project is simply an N-Puzzle demo and solver written in HTML5 using [PhaserJS](https://phaser.io). The goal was to mostly to explore creating games in web-browser space, dealing with variable resolution changes and limitations with Javascript.

The amazing random artworks were created by [@hikaika_guu](https://twitter.com/hikaika_guu/).

Perhaps I'll release a more optimized native version that can handle variable NxM puzzles one day...
