I started in Koei Tecmo Singapore, where I worked as a full-stack web developer for the localization team in [Nobunyaga's Ambition](/industry/nyaga).  

I was then transfered to Japan to be a web developer for [AKB48's Ambition](/industry/akb48). 

When I returned to Singapore, I primarily worked on localization of AAA console titles such as [Nobunaga's Ambitioni: Taishi](/industry/taishi) and [RTK13](/industry/rtk13).  

After 5 years in Koei Tecmo, I decided to try my hands in teaching in [DigiPen Singapore](https://www.digipen.edu.sg). 
There, I teach arts freshmen programming and software development modules. I also teach in [continuing education](https://www.digipen.edu.sg/academics/continuing-education) programs for adults.

After a couple of years, I joined UDream Entertainment to work as a backend engineer for the first iteration of [Paper Heroes](/industry/paper-heroes).

A year later, I returned to teaching in DigiPen Singapore. Right now, I teach around 300 computer science freshmen in project classes, and around 50 arts freshmen in introductory programming modules.  

In my own spare time, I like to work on several hobby projects as well. 
Here are the ones that are public:
- [Dots and Circles Again](/projects/dnc)
- [Pathfinding Visualizer](/projects/pathfinding)
- [Mallory](/projects/mallory)
- [Flocking Demo](/projects/flocking)
- [NPuzzle Demo](/projects/npuzzle)

And of course, not forgeting the projects I did when I was a student:
- [Nightmare](/student/nightmare)
- [EchoLight](/student/echolight)
- [Dots and Circles](/student/dnc)
- [Heavy Indestructable Tanks](/student/hit)
- [Gods Only Love Me](/student/gods)
