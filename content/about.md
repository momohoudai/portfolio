Welcome to my little slice of the internets. 
I'm momo, but you can also call me moom!
It's a little messy but feel free to make yourself comfortable and take a look around!

Some facts about me:
* I'm from Singapore!
* I love programming and make my computer go *beep boop*!
* My main programming languages are C/C++, Python and Javascript. 
* I can speak English, Japanese and Mandarin.
* I love music and can play the piano
* I'm happily married <3
* I'm easily distracted, play too many games and have too many hobbies. You might might find scraps of my interests lying around so watch your step!
