This is basically a survival guide to our house, in a form of an FAQ.
Hopefully you guys enjoy the stay here :) 


# Where is Gerald physically?


{{<rawhtml>}}

Gerald is currently in Singapore!

<div id="countdown"></div>
<script>
      // Set the date to count down to (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
      const countDownDate = new Date("2023-06-03T00:00:00").getTime();

      // Update the countdown every second
      const countdownTimer = setInterval(function() {

        // Get the current date and time
        const now = new Date().getTime();

        // Calculate the remaining time
        const distance = countDownDate - now;

        // Calculate days, hours, minutes, and seconds
        const days = Math.floor(distance / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
        const hours = Math.floor((distance % (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)) / (1000 * 60 * 60));
        const minutes = Math.floor((distance % (1000 * 60 * 60)) / (1000 * 60));
        const seconds = Math.floor((distance % (1000 * 60)) / 1000);

        // Construct the remaining time string
        const countdownString = `${days} days ${hours} hours ${minutes} mins ${seconds} seconds`;
         

        // Set the text of the countdown div to the remaining time string
        document.getElementById("countdown").innerText = "Gerald will be in Japan in: " + countdownString;

        // If the countdown is finished, display a message
        if (distance < 0) {
          clearInterval(countdownTimer);
          document.getElementById("countdown").innerText = "";
        }
      }, 1000);

# House maintainance

## Dock lock keeps making beeping sounds!

Tap the YALE card. I have placed one at the shelf near the front door.
There is no other way, so please leave the YALE card where everyone can find it.

## Where are the toileries and paper towels?

At the balcony storage. 

## Anything to look out for when using the washer and dryer?

Before using the dryer, you should clear the lint filter (near the door of the dryer at the bottom). 
You might want to clean the washer once in a while. 
For now, we have washer cleaning capsules located on the movable shelves next to the washer. 
It's the one with korean words.

## Where are the electric circuit breakers?

There are 2 circuit breakers: one next to the door inside of our house, one outside, both near the main door. 

## Internet is dead!

You can try to reset the router and modem by turning on/off the power.
They are to the left of the TV.

## Are there batteries and tools?

I have placed all batteries and tools into the TV drawers. 
You should find a set of screwdrivers and allen keys and...stuff.

## Doorbell ran out of power!

You will have to pry open the doorbell from the bottom. 
You should see some kind of a slot there.
You will most likely need to use a screwdriver with a flathead.
The batteries are in the TV drawers.

## How do I know when the door lock is running out of power?

It *should* start to act suspiciously tired.
Like...not a springiest of onions. 

## Door lock ran out of power!

If you are inside, you can open the lid (unscrew using your hands or if you can find a fitting Allen Key; I left it quite loose). It requires 4 AA batteries.

If you are outside, I hope you have fingernails.
You will have to pry the bottom latch of the door lock. 
From there, you can put emergency batteries to power up the lock.
The emergency batteries you need are the round ones.


## Aircon is leaking?!

The main way to solve this is to use the heavy duty vacuum located at the balcony to suck out the water from the pipe located at the bottom of the master bedroom's toilet sink.
Once you fix up the vacuum, insert the pipe into the vacuum and wrap a piece of cloth around it to maximaze the suck.
You can always call aircon servicing; they will end up doing the exact same thing for around S$50.

## Aircon Servicing

This is the one we currently use:

* Name: AireMax Aircon Pte Ltd.
* Phone: 83131211
* Email: info@airemaxsg.com


## Where is the letter box key?

It's the one with the long wooden block attached to the key chain.

## Fumigation?

Once in a while, there will be a notice in the lift saying when they are fumigating the rubbish chute. 
Our rubbish cute can be located at the bottom of the kitchen sink.
Before the day of fumigation, it is advised to seal the chute with tape.
Otherwise, you might see cockroaches (esp baby ones) all over the kitchen floor the next morning.

# Food

## Anything to note about Shunfu Mart?

Fish soup stall is closed at 7:30pm.
Roasted meat stall closes around that timing too (maybe a bit later).
Lots of stalls are closed on Monday. 
The drink stall auntie (the one that sells beer and desserts) doesn't speak. 

## Are there convenient stores?

There's a 7-11 and a Hao Mart, along the stretch towards Prata House.

## Is there food at night?

- The Prata House. 
- There's also some fishball noodle store.
- I think Mookata closes late.
- Scissors cut curry closes late as well.
- There is a 24/7 Coffee Bean nearby
- Otherwise there is a 24-hour Macdonalds at Bishan Park so you can call GrabFood for it.

## Are there hawker centers/kopitiam?

- Shunfu Block 23. Notably it has King of Fried Rice. 
- Shunfu Block 24. Notably it has Shunfu Prata. If you are going for the prata, please go at offpeak hours. The queue can be quite insane. The drink stall uncle that walks around something calls "1 dollar" "100 dollars".
- 236a Upper Thomson Road. Notably it has Go2Eat western which is really good. It also has Chuan Chuan.
- 244 Upper Thomson Road. It has good Ban Mian. Also the nearest place you can get Lor Mai Kai (but it's not that great).

## Shopping Centers?

We have two: 

- Bishan which is 1 MRT stop away
- Thomson Plaza, which is a straight bus ride from the Shunfu Market bus station (there's only one bus there) and is also walkable.

## Supermarket options?
Sheng Siong is the nearest. The other option is NTUC at Thomson Plaza.

## Cafes?
There's a gazillion cafes. Too many to mention.

## Bubble tea?
You can get Taiwanese pearl milk tea at Xiang's Dessert, next to Columbus. 
They sell really good and affordable Taiwanese food.
Please patronize them.
I don't want them to close down T_T.
