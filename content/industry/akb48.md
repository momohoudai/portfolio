[AKB48's Ambition (AKB48の野望)](https://www.gamecity.ne.jp/akb48/) is a browser-based game by Koei Tecmo. It is based on a fantastical world where member of the popular idol group AKB48 battle out as witches.
                
The game was avaliable on several Japanese platforms such as Yahoo!mobage, myGameCity, dGame and GREE. As of 25th June 2018, the service for the game ended.

In this project, I worked in Japan for over a year as a full-stack developer. My responsibilities include maintaining backend servers, developing gameplay content, writing tools to increase productivity as well as leading the programming team.
