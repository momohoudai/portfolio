[Nobunyaga's Ambition (のぶニャがの野望)](https://www.gamecity.ne.jp/nobunyaga/) is a browser-based game by Koei Tecmo. It is based on Japan's Sengoku Period, with its characters anthropomorphized as cats.
                
The game is in Japanese and had been localized into Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese and English. In Japan, it's avaliable on several platforms such as Yahoo!mobage, myGameCity, dGame, niconico, mixi and colopl.

Overseas, it's avaliable on the platforms Wasabii (Taiwan) and Blue Panda (China). It also has webview applications on iOS and Android.
            
In this project, I worked in Singapore for 2 years as a full-stack developer. My responsibilities include maintaining backend servers, developing gameplay content,  writing tools to increase productivity as well as leading the localization team.

As of 2021/22/02 (にゃんの日 or 'Cat Day' in Japan) 1500JPT, operations has officially ceased.
