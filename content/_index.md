# Hey, I'm Gerald!

This is my home page! I am a software engineer with a passion for teaching. My specialization is in games development, but I love to learn about technology from other fields as well!

# I'm a programmer
I have been programming for 13 years. I have spent a total of around 6 professional years in the game industry. 5 of them were spent in Koei Tecmo Singapore and 1 was in Udream Entertainment. 

I have worked on several console, web and mobile titles. I have experience working on and leading teams in both development and servicing environments for these titles. 

I have developed content for frontend, maintained the infrastructure for backend systems, and came up with build systems and tools that improve developer's workflow for the projects I'm involved in. 

# I'm a lecturer
I currently teach as a lecturer at DigiPen Institute of Technology, Singapore. 

There, I teach topics related to games development, software engineering and programming. I also run project modules for up to 280 freshmen where they form teams learn to develop a software application from idealization to implementation.

Outside of teaching, I develop teaching materials and graded items for modules that I am involved in, write and maintain several in-house tools that improve the workflow of managing them, as well as writing and maintaining in-house software libraries that are used by students in their project modules.
