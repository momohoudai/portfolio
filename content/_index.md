# Hey, I'm Gerald!

This is my home page! I am a software engineer with a passion for teaching. My specialization is in games development, but I love to learn about technology from other fields as well!

# I'm a programmer
I have been programming for 13 years. I have spent a total of around 6 professional years in the game industry. 5 of them were spent in Koei Tecmo Singapore and 1 was in Udream Entertainment. 

My experience in the industry includes console, web and mobile titles. I have experience in both development and operational cycles of several titles, and have lead teams in those environments. 

I enjoy working on most software engineering aspects of a project. I have developed content for frontend, planned/setup the infrastructure for backend, and came up with build systems and tools for the various projects I'm involved in. 

# I'm a lecturer
I currently teach at a tertiary level, currently serving my 3rd year as a lecturer at DigiPen Institute of Technology, Singapore. 

The topics I teach include games development, software engineering and programming topics.
