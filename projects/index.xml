Be a Circle!Â Be anything you want, just avoid what you are not!
Dots and Circles is an experimental Bullet Hell game that uses mouse as movement. Collect as many bullets as you can to see how much you can score!
Move around with the mouse Left click to change between being a Dot or a Circle. This game and its engine is written from scratch with the &amp;lsquo;handmade&amp;rsquo; philosophy.</description></item><item><title>Flocking</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/projects/flocking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/projects/flocking/</guid><description>This is a flocking demo written in the very fun to use p5.js over a weekend. It is only tested on Chrome, so some features might not be avaliable on other browsers.

It is a game where you play as Karu, trapped in a nightmare, a nightmare where he can only move left and right, and jump; he cannot stop. Monsters will appear from the sides to eat him and touching them is fatal. Equipped with only a sword, try to defeat as many monsters as possible!</description></item><item><title>Mallory</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/projects/mallory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/projects/mallory/</guid><description>Mallory is a simple game prototype I made in Unity. It is an endless vertical jumping platformer, where players try to climb as high as they can and leave their mark!
The motivation is to explore procedurally generated levels and also using Unity as an engine.
I will probably create a more optimal desktop version some time in the future.

The goal was to mostly to explore creating games in web-browser space, dealing with variable resolution changes and limitations with Javascript.
The amazing random artworks were created by @hikaika_guu.
Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll release a more optimized native version that can handle variable NxM puzzles one day&amp;hellip;

It is written in ReactJS.
