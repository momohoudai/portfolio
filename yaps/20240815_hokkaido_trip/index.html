I did searched that Japan did fail to turn Hokkaido into a farming region and turned to the US for help.</p><p>Driving there was mostly as pleasant as most other cities, but there is some serious illegal parking culture going on there; the amount of 3 lane roads turning into 2 is the most I have ever seen in a city. Maybe that&rsquo;s why the Times rental service staff highlighted illegal parking heavily&mldr;?</p><p>Oh yes, roads are surprisingly bad. On top of the chain of hazard lights, there were lots of roadworks.</p><p>I love corn though, so it was a little paradise for me!</p><p>I also had miso ramen. It was interesting. The place we went was Aji No Sanpei, where it was supposedly the first store to have it. It didn&rsquo;t seem too popular compared to Sumire which had an insaaaanr queue. Either ways, it&rsquo;s good ramen. I heard that there&rsquo;s a famous miso ramen shop near Waseda in Tokyo trained under the Sumire chef. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll try that!</p></div></div></div></body></html>
