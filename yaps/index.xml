I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly know what these feelings and thoughts are so many it&amp;rsquo;s better to just articulate and put it out here as I try to process this.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>100 questions revisited</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/yaps/20240602_100_questions_revisited/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jun 2024 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/yaps/20240602_100_questions_revisited/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was cleaning up my tumblr the other day (mostly because I discovered that tumblr can edit HTML so I went to theme it myself) and I came across a really old post of mine from 2016 answering like 100 questions. I thought it would be fun to do it again 8 years later and compare my old and new answers!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unity charging for runtime</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/yaps/20230920_thoughts_on_unity_charging_for_runtime/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2023 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/yaps/20230920_thoughts_on_unity_charging_for_runtime/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, Unity announced about it&amp;rsquo;s runtime charges, which will suddenly apply to all developers using the engine.
I feel I need to let out my raw thoughts about it because there is so many things to say and so many things to expect in the future.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Japan is really something</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/yaps/20230502_japan_is_really_something/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 May 2023 21:20:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/yaps/20230502_japan_is_really_something/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in Japan for a year before for work purposes.
This time, I&amp;rsquo;m going to stay for a couple of years to accompany my wife as she does her Masters.
I thought that it would be fun to list down some random things that I personally find interesting about Japan, since this place is kind of like my 3rd home at this point.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Going from Markdown to Asciidoc</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/yaps/20210422_going_from_md_to_adoc/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Apr 2023 14:44:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/yaps/20210422_going_from_md_to_adoc/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here I&amp;rsquo;ll pin down my thought process of changing my work&amp;rsquo;s documentations from Markdown to Asciidoc.
I have been switching endlessly back and forth between them and it&amp;rsquo;s getting really annoying because I just want to do my work at some point.
Hopefully after writing this, I will never look back until maybe 5 years later.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I tried ChatGPT</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/yaps/20230210_chatgpt_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2023 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/yaps/20230210_chatgpt_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have been spending an unhealthy amount of time for the past 3 weeks playing around with ChatGPT instead of doing my work.
Seeing it evolve (some might argue &amp;lsquo;devolve&amp;rsquo;) day by day with &amp;lsquo;better&amp;rsquo; filters was interesting.
It&amp;rsquo;s quite amazing to see the different things it &lt;em>was&lt;/em> capable of.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Website Facelift</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/yaps/20220724_website_facelift/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/yaps/20220724_website_facelift/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s time for another facelift!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seriously though, I remembered liking the previous site design.
A year later, however, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t look at it straight in the eye anymore.
Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s because I developed a stronger opinion on what I want my site to be.
Here I&amp;rsquo;ll share some of my thoughts.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
