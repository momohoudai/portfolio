This is probably a trick that only works in C/C++ because of how the not (!) operator works with integers.
While it&rsquo;s usefulness is dubious in C++, it might be useful in C.</p></section><hr class=blog-list-content-seperator></article><article class=blog-list-content><header><h1 class=blog-list-content-title><a href=/blog/20230502_japan_is_really_something/>Japan is really something</a></h1><h4 class=blog-list-content-date><time datetime=2023-05-02T21:20:00+08:00>May 2, 2023</time></h4></header><section><p>I&rsquo;ve lived in Japan for a year before for work purposes.
This time, I&rsquo;m going to stay for a couple of years to accompany my wife as she does her Masters.
I thought that it would be fun to list down some random things that I personally find interesting about Japan, since this place is kind of like my 3rd home at this point.</p></section><hr class=blog-list-content-seperator></article><article class=blog-list-content><header><h1 class=blog-list-content-title><a href=/blog/20210422_going_from_md_to_adoc/>Going from Markdown to Asciidoc</a></h1><h4 class=blog-list-content-date><time datetime=2023-04-22T14:44:00+08:00>Apr 22, 2023</time></h4></header><section><p>Here I&rsquo;ll pin down my thought process of changing my work&rsquo;s documentations from Markdown to Asciidoc.
I have been switching endlessly back and forth between them and it&rsquo;s getting really annoying because I just want to do my work at some point.
Hopefully after writing this, I will never look back until maybe 5 years later.</p></section><hr class=blog-list-content-seperator></article><article class=blog-list-content><header><h1 class=blog-list-content-title><a href=/blog/20230411_index_match_tldr/>INDEX/MATCH tl;dr</a></h1><h4 class=blog-list-content-date><time datetime=2023-04-10T12:00:00+08:00>Apr 10, 2023</time></h4></header><section><p>I was playing with Excel recently and for the hundredth time got stumped by how to use the INDEX/MATCH combo.

Seeing it evolve (some might argue &lsquo;devolve&rsquo;) day by day with &lsquo;better&rsquo; filters was interesting.

It&rsquo;s been a while since I played an open world western RPG.
I believe the last one I played was Skyrim when it first released in 2011.

I remember positive emotions playing the game but all I remembered as an adult before playing it again was that you are the Vault Dweller from Vault 13 and you need to find a water chip within some kind of a time limit.</p></section><hr class=blog-list-content-seperator></article></div></div></div><footer>Powered By Hugo | v2.0 | Â© 2022 Gerald Wong</footer></body></html>
