Act 2 somehow got Corruption + Dead Branch + Runic Pyramid. Super drunk with power.
Always take Corruption though. Using it on non-defend skill cards is somehow ridiculous.
This is also the first time I tied Sever Soul, which I thought is a dead card. It is less dead than I expected.</p><h1 id=5--20230930--ironclad--a0--around-act-2>#5 | 20230930 | Ironclad | A0 | Around act 2</h1><p>Took pandora&rsquo;s box and suddenly I have zero defends. Played extremely poorly in Act 1 overall.</p><p>Lesson learnt: Don&rsquo;t Pandora Box all your defends away.</p><h1 id=4--20230930--ironclad--a0--f57>#4 | 20230930 | Ironclad | A0 | F57</h1><p>This is a Runic Pyramid run. The deck size ended up a bit big, but we had 2 Offerings and 1 Battle Trance, allowing us to quickly get Demon Form. Getting Uppercut at the last minute was quite clutch to remove the artifact buffs on the last few bosses. After this run, I&rsquo;m pretty sure I rank Runic Pyramid above most energy giving relics.</p><h1 id=3--20230917--ironclad--a0--f56>#3 | 20230917 | Ironclad | A0 | F56</h1><p>Act 1: Took Hemokinesis early to see its strength. Took Blood for Blood. Bought Pocket Watch. Damage and card cycle was so high we beat Slime boss in like 2 turns.</p><p>Act 2: Lack of AOE and block made me hestitate going for elite and boss fight but they somehow turned out well. Deck so far has no &rsquo;exhaust other cards&rsquo;. Was given Offering, Corruption, Immolate. Took Offering because I had 4 powers. Was afraid to get Immolate because I don&rsquo;t have any exhaust card. Mistake?</p><p>Act 3: Surprising didn&rsquo;t lose to any elite. Was offered Second Wind many times but didn&rsquo;t pick it&mldr;</p><p>Died at heart. Not enough block. Maybe I should&rsquo;ve taken True Grit Or Second Wind when offered?</p><h1 id=2--20230917--ironclad--a0--f57>#2 | 20230917 | Ironclad | A0 | F57</h1><p>Received Omamori early, which turns out to block Necronomicon curse at Act 2, which is huge.</p><p>Had relics that give block at turns 1,2,3. Barricade was taken (deck can reliably block alot) then Velvet Choker (thinking that deck needed more energy to scale faster especially with Barricade). Eventually found Entrench. Went for tons of draw.</p><p>Raptomancer almost owned me at Act 3 because I have no AOE.</p><p>Necronomicon is actually insane</p><h1 id=1--20230917--ironclad--a0--f54>#1 | 20230917 | Ironclad | A0 | F54</h1><p>Corruption/Dark Embrace with lots of Anger.</p><p>Died at twins. Felt like I didn&rsquo;t have enough ways to accelerate into win cons. Twin fight feels like you need to get your wincon by turn 2-ish.</p><p>Deck was otherwise okay and have no problems with Act 3 even when Velvet Choker was in the way.</p><h1 id=ironclad-cards>Ironclad Cards</h1><h2 id=core>Core</h2><p>Dark Embrace</p><ul><li>Basically makes exhaust cards draw.</li></ul><p>Corruption</p><ul><li>Steamrolls hallway fights.</li><li>Dead card against longer boss fights but still&mldr;</li></ul><p>Bloodletting</p><ul><li>Basically free energy</li></ul><p>Exhume</p><ul><li>Very strong because Ironclad has alot of &lsquo;do big thing but exhaust&rsquo; cards.</li></ul><p>Impervious</p><ul><li>Way better than it looks.
