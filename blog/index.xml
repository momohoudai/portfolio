I was a little inspired to attempt to write simple webapps without the use of any frameworks.
One of them is avaliable here: &lt;a href="https://momohoudai.github.io/fvf/">FvF&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also have been using Google Sheets and did a heavy amount AppScript stuff for another one of my side-projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post is just some personal reflections going back to use vanilla Javascript/CSS in 2023.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Unity charging for runtime</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20230920_thoughts_on_unity_charging_for_runtime/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2023 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20230920_thoughts_on_unity_charging_for_runtime/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, Unity announced about it&amp;rsquo;s runtime charges, which will suddenly apply to all developers using the engine.
I feel I need to let out my raw thoughts about it because there is so many things to say and so many things to expect in the future.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Primix Dev Postmorterm</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20230810_primix_dev_postmorterm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 23:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20230810_primix_dev_postmorterm/</guid><description>&lt;p>Alright, the game is &lt;a href="https://momohoudai.itch.io/primix">out on itch.io&lt;/a> for free.
This is the 2nd game I have made using a rewrite of the engine I used in &lt;a href="https://momohoudai.itch.io/dots_and_circles">dots and circles&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Case of the Golden Idol</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20230506_case_of_the_golden_idol/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 12:31:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20230506_case_of_the_golden_idol/</guid><description>&lt;p>After playing &amp;ldquo;Return To Obra Dinn&amp;rdquo;, a few people have asked me to look into &amp;ldquo;Case of the Golden Idol&amp;rdquo;.
It was also recommended by Lucas Pope, developer of &lt;em>Return To Obra Dinn&lt;/em>.
While waiting for my VISA in Singapore, I managed to allocate some time to play it on stream.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Point on triangle algorithms</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20230517_overlapping_triangles/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 11:16:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20230517_overlapping_triangles/</guid><description>&lt;p>A game I&amp;rsquo;m working on requires me to check if a point is overlapped by a triangle.
Being a dumb engineer who can&amp;rsquo;t come up wiith his own algorithm, google gave me 3 algorithms.
Here I&amp;rsquo;m just going to share the algorithms and their performances.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>[C/C++] Flatten integer to 0/1</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20230505_cpp_boolean_flattening_trick/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 May 2023 13:25:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20230505_cpp_boolean_flattening_trick/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a quick trick to &amp;lsquo;flatten&amp;rsquo; an integer into a 1 or 0.
This is probably a trick that only works in C/C++ because of how the not (!) operator works with integers.
While it&amp;rsquo;s usefulness is dubious in C++, it might be useful in C.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Japan is really something</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20230502_japan_is_really_something/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 May 2023 21:20:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20230502_japan_is_really_something/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in Japan for a year before for work purposes.
This time, I&amp;rsquo;m going to stay for a couple of years to accompany my wife as she does her Masters.
I thought that it would be fun to list down some random things that I personally find interesting about Japan, since this place is kind of like my 3rd home at this point.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Going from Markdown to Asciidoc</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20210422_going_from_md_to_adoc/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Apr 2023 14:44:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20210422_going_from_md_to_adoc/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here I&amp;rsquo;ll pin down my thought process of changing my work&amp;rsquo;s documentations from Markdown to Asciidoc.
I have been switching endlessly back and forth between them and it&amp;rsquo;s getting really annoying because I just want to do my work at some point.
Hopefully after writing this, I will never look back until maybe 5 years later.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>[XLS] INDEX/MATCH tl;dr</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20230411_index_match_tldr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2023 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20230411_index_match_tldr/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was playing with Excel recently and for the hundredth time got stumped by how to use the INDEX/MATCH combo.

Seeing it evolve (some might argue &amp;lsquo;devolve&amp;rsquo;) day by day with &amp;lsquo;better&amp;rsquo; filters was interesting.
It&amp;rsquo;s quite amazing to see the different things it &lt;em>was&lt;/em> capable of.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Cyberpunk 2077</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20230114_cyberpunk_2077_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20230114_cyberpunk_2077_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I finally took the time to complete Cyberpunk 2077 today.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I played an open world western RPG.
I believe the last one I played was Skyrim when it first released in 2011.
&amp;hellip;man, that was really a long time ago.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Fallout 2</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20221217_fallout_2_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2022 14:44:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20221217_fallout_2_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I played Fallout 2 in 2022 and here are my thoughts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like Fallout 1, I have also played Fallout 2 as a kid. Just like Fallout 1, it&amp;rsquo;s so refreshing to play it in 2022.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Fallout 1</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20221117_fallout_1_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 14:44:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20221117_fallout_1_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I played Fallout 1 in 2022 and here are my thoughts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, let me give a disclaimer and say that I have played Fallout 1 as a kid when the game is still in a CD.
I remember positive emotions playing the game but all I remembered as an adult before playing it again was that you are the Vault Dweller from Vault 13 and you need to find a water chip within some kind of a time limit.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Stray</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20220731_stray_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2022 13:40:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20220731_stray_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I just played this game called &amp;lsquo;Stray&amp;rsquo; over the week just to check out what all the hype was about.
Before I go on, I would like to say that it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty decent game.
I can see why there are people who loved and hate it.
Here I&amp;rsquo;m just going to pen down thoughts I find about the game.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sorry about the word vomit in advance, and of course, spoilers from here on!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Website Facelift</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20220724_website_facelift/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20220724_website_facelift/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s time for another facelift!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seriously though, I remembered liking the previous site design.
A year later, however, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t look at it straight in the eye anymore.
Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s because I developed a stronger opinion on what I want my site to be.
Here I&amp;rsquo;ll share some of my thoughts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deriving Triangle to Triangle transformation matrix</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20220425_derive_triangle_to_triangle_transform/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2022 23:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20220425_derive_triangle_to_triangle_transform/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how I derive the transformation matrix for getting from triangle A to triangle B to do shadows in my 2D engine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dots and Circles Dev Postmorterm</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20211201_dots_and_circles_dev_postmorterm/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 23:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20211201_dots_and_circles_dev_postmorterm/</guid><description>&lt;p>Alright, the game is &lt;a href="https://momohoudai.itch.io/dots-and-circles">out on itch.io&lt;/a> for free!

Sometimes, I would code and &lt;em>know&lt;/em> of a trick but had forgotten how to go about implementing it because they can look as arcane as Template Metaprogramming.
Hopefully, I can document some of my knowledge of these tricks in this blog.
Here, I will introduce what I call the &amp;lsquo;Glue&amp;rsquo; macro trick.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A small shortcoming of return-by-value</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20210324_shortcomings_of_return_by_value_c_style_constructors/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Mar 2021 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20210324_shortcomings_of_return_by_value_c_style_constructors/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, while coding on my personal C/C++ game engine project, I ran into a surprising shortcoming of functions that returns an object by value.
