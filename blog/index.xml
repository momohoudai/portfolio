Now that some time has passed and a handful of people have played the game, I felt that there is no better time then to jot down my experiences developing this small arcade game, lest I forget (again).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Byte Alignment Notes</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20211118_bytes_alignment_notes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20211118_bytes_alignment_notes/</guid><description>&lt;p>When dealing with raw memory directly, there might come the need to align your memory to the nearest of some power of 2.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dirty C/C++</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/dirty_c/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/dirty_c/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here is a collection of cool snippets of C/C++ code. Updated regularly. Used to show superiority and implode the minds of my students. Also to use in my own code, of course, whenever viable.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Perspective Projection Matrix</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20210801_perspective_projection_matrix/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20210801_perspective_projection_matrix/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was searching around internet for a full derivation for the 3D Perspective Projection Matrix to apply to my handmade software renderer and I was surprised by how little information I could find about it. That prompted me to write this post, to document the derivation of the matrix, at least in my own eyes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Circle to Finite Line Collision</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20210428_circle_line_collision/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jul 2021 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20210428_circle_line_collision/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, I had to derive this particular collision detection algorithm for my bullet hell genre game. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting algorithm that can be expanded to deal with the &amp;lsquo;moving circle vs static circle&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;moving circle vs moving circle&amp;rsquo; problems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>'Glue' C-preprocessor trick</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20210406_glue_c_preprocessor_trick/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Apr 2021 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20210406_glue_c_preprocessor_trick/</guid><description>&lt;p>Macro tricks are rare to find nowadays. Sometimes, I would code and &lt;em>know&lt;/em> of a trick but had forgotten how to go about implementing it because they can look as arcane as Template Metaprogramming. Hopefully, I can document some of my knowledge of these tricks in this blog. Here, I will introduce what I call the &amp;lsquo;Glue&amp;rsquo; macro trick.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A small shortcoming of return-by-value</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20210324_shortcomings_of_return_by_value_c_style_constructors/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Mar 2021 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20210324_shortcomings_of_return_by_value_c_style_constructors/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, while coding on my personal C/C++ game engine project, I ran into a surprising shortcoming of functions that returns an object by value. This was when I was still trying to keep things consistant in my project and went for a functional-programming style.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
