Note that these are for Raspberry PI OS. Some of these will work on other Linux distributions (especially Debian since Raspbian derives from it). te that these are for Raspberry PI OS.
But you know, Linux being linux and distributions being distributions, not all of them will work for everything. Since I only use Raspberry PI right now, I&amp;rsquo;ll just stick to the commands being for the Raspberry PI.</description></item><item><title>I tried ChatGPT</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20230210_chatgpt_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2023 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20230210_chatgpt_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have been spending an unhealthy amount of time for the past 3 weeks playing around with ChatGPT instead of doing my work.
Seeing it evolve (some might argue &amp;lsquo;devolve&amp;rsquo;) day by day with &amp;lsquo;better&amp;rsquo; filters was interesting.
It&amp;rsquo;s quite amazing to see the different things it &lt;em>was&lt;/em> capable of.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cyberpunk 2077 thoughts</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20230114_cyberpunk_2077_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20230114_cyberpunk_2077_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I finally took the time to complete Cyberpunk 2077 today.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I played an open world western RPG.
I believe the last one I played was Skyrim when it first released in 2011.
&amp;hellip;man, that was really a long time ago.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Fallout 2</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20221217_fallout_2_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2022 14:44:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20221217_fallout_2_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I played Fallout 2 in 2022 and here are my thoughts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like Fallout 1, I have also played Fallout 2 as a kid. Just like Fallout 1, it&amp;rsquo;s so refreshing to play it in 2022.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Fallout 1</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20221117_fallout_1_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 14:44:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20221117_fallout_1_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I played Fallout 1 in 2022 and here are my thoughts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, let me give a disclaimer and say that I have played Fallout 1 as a kid when the game is still in a CD.
I remember positive emotions playing the game but all I remembered as an adult before playing it again was that you are the Vault Dweller from Vault 13 and you need to find a water chip within some kind of a time limit.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on 'Stray'</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20220731_stray_thoughts/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jul 2022 13:40:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20220731_stray_thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p>I just played this game called &amp;lsquo;Stray&amp;rsquo; over the week just to check out what all the hype was about.
Before I go on, I would like to say that it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty decent game.
I can see why there are people who loved and hate it.
Here I&amp;rsquo;m just going to pen down thoughts I find about the game.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sorry about the word vomit in advance, and of course, spoilers from here on!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Website Facelift</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20220724_website_facelift/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20220724_website_facelift/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s time for another facelift!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seriously though, I remembered liking the previous site design.
A year later, however, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t look at it straight in the eye anymore.
Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s because I developed a stronger opinion on what I want my site to be.
Here I&amp;rsquo;ll share some of my thoughts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deriving Triangle to Triangle transformation matrix</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20220425_derive_triangle_to_triangle_transform/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2022 23:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20220425_derive_triangle_to_triangle_transform/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how I derive the transformation matrix for getting from triangle A to triangle B to do shadows in my 2D engine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dots and Circles Afterthoughts</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20211201_dots_and_circles_afterthoughts-copy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 23:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20211201_dots_and_circles_afterthoughts-copy/</guid><description>&lt;p>Alright, the game is &lt;a href="https://momohoudai.itch.io/dots-and-circles">out on itch.io&lt;/a> for free! Now that some time has passed and a handful of people have played the game, I felt that there is no better time then to jot down my experiences developing this small arcade game, lest I forget (again).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Byte Alignment Notes</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20211118_bytes_alignment_notes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20211118_bytes_alignment_notes/</guid><description>&lt;p>When dealing with raw memory directly, there might come the need to align your memory to the nearest of some power of 2.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dirty C/C++</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/dirty_c/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/dirty_c/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here is a collection of cool snippets of C/C++ code.

That prompted me to write this post, to document the derivation of the matrix, at least in my own eyes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Circle to Finite Line Collision</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20210428_circle_line_collision/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jul 2021 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20210428_circle_line_collision/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, I had to derive this particular collision detection algorithm for my bullet hell genre game. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting algorithm that can be expanded to deal with the &amp;lsquo;moving circle vs static circle&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;moving circle vs moving circle&amp;rsquo; problems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>'Glue' C-preprocessor trick</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20210406_glue_c_preprocessor_trick/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Apr 2021 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20210406_glue_c_preprocessor_trick/</guid><description>&lt;p>Macro tricks are rare to find nowadays. Sometimes, I would code and &lt;em>know&lt;/em> of a trick but had forgotten how to go about implementing it because they can look as arcane as Template Metaprogramming. Hopefully, I can document some of my knowledge of these tricks in this blog.
