To be honest, I have nothing but praises for this game. 11/10 must play.</p><p>There are many aspects to praise about the game that is hard to express in words let alone an article. It is an art piece, and it feels like a masterpiece in the realms of adventure games.</p><p>The writing is typical of Shu Takumi. You can expect the same kind of excellent writing, pacing, theatrics, plot twists, care to characters and their dynamics with other characters.</p><p>The art is very consistent and the animation is clever; they are great in general and hilariously cheap when they need to be for comedic effect.</p><p>The biggest thing for me is how integrated the gameplay is with the story. It was a little confusing to me where they were going with such an unscalable mechanic at first but all that is kind of irrelevant if the gameplay is there to supplement the story.</p><p>It&rsquo;s beautifully done, which makes me a little sad when I know that games like this will only ever be a niche. How do you even market such a game?</p></div></div></div><footer>Powered By Hugo | v2.0 | Â© 2024 Momoko Mopiko</footer></body></html>
