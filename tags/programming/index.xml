For the hundredth time in the past years, I open the same damn website and the same damn explanation which took awhile because my brain actually needed to work to understand what&amp;rsquo;s going on.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to understand. I just want it to work. Yes, brain is smol.
So here I&amp;rsquo;m just gonna drop how to use it.</description></item><item><title>My Raspberry PI Cookbook</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/_rpi_cookbook/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2023 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/_rpi_cookbook/</guid><description>I figured that I might as well save a Raspberry PI cookbook somewhere.
Note that these are for Raspberry PI OS. Some of these will work on other Linux distributions (especially Debian since Raspbian derives from it). te that these are for Raspberry PI OS.
But you know, Linux being linux and distributions being distributions, not all of them will work for everything. Since I only use Raspberry PI right now, I&amp;rsquo;ll just stick to the commands being for the Raspberry PI.</description></item><item><title>Byte Alignment Notes</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20211118_bytes_alignment_notes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20211118_bytes_alignment_notes/</guid><description>&lt;p>When dealing with raw memory directly, there might come the need to align your memory to the nearest of some power of 2.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>'Glue' C-preprocessor trick</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20210406_glue_c_preprocessor_trick/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Apr 2021 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20210406_glue_c_preprocessor_trick/</guid><description>&lt;p>Macro tricks are rare to find nowadays. Sometimes, I would code and &lt;em>know&lt;/em> of a trick but had forgotten how to go about implementing it because they can look as arcane as Template Metaprogramming. Hopefully, I can document some of my knowledge of these tricks in this blog. Here, I will introduce what I call the &amp;lsquo;Glue&amp;rsquo; macro trick.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A small shortcoming of return-by-value</title><link>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20210324_shortcomings_of_return_by_value_c_style_constructors/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Mar 2021 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://geraldwong.net/blog/20210324_shortcomings_of_return_by_value_c_style_constructors/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, while coding on my personal C/C++ game engine project, I ran into a surprising shortcoming of functions that returns an object by value. This was when I was still trying to keep things consistant in my project and went for a functional-programming style.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
