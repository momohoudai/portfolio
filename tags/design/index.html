Let&rsquo;s get the easy stuff out of the way first. The game has amazing music, UI, art style and theme.
The team has always been excellent in these aspects and are often brought up in case studies in my classes.
With that out of the way, here are my thoughts on my playthrough.</p></div><hr class=blog-list-content-seperator></article><article class=blog-list-content><header><div class=blog-title><a href=/blog/20230506_case_of_the_golden_idol/>Thoughts on Case of the Golden Idol</a></h1><div class=blog-date-tag-wrapper><div class=blog-date><time datetime=2023-06-08T12:31:00+08:00>Jun 8, 2023</time></div><div class=blog-tag>design</div></div></header><div class=blog-body><p>After playing &ldquo;Return To Obra Dinn&rdquo;, a few people have asked me to look into &ldquo;Case of the Golden Idol&rdquo;.

It&rsquo;s been a while since I played an open world western RPG.
I believe the last one I played was Skyrim when it first released in 2011.
&mldr;man, that was really a long time ago.</p></div><hr class=blog-list-content-seperator></article><article class=blog-list-content><header><div class=blog-title><a href=/blog/20221217_fallout_2_thoughts/>Thoughts on Fallout 2</a></h1><div class=blog-date-tag-wrapper><div class=blog-date><time datetime=2022-12-30T14:44:00+08:00>Dec 30, 2022</time></div><div class=blog-tag>design</div></div></header><div class=blog-body><p>I played Fallout 2 in 2022 and here are my thoughts.</p><p>Like Fallout 1, I have also played Fallout 2 as a kid.

I remember positive emotions playing the game but all I remembered as an adult before playing it again was that you are the Vault Dweller from Vault 13 and you need to find a water chip within some kind of a time limit.</p></div><hr class=blog-list-content-seperator></article><article class=blog-list-content><header><div class=blog-title><a href=/blog/20220731_stray_thoughts/>Thoughts on Stray</a></h1><div class=blog-date-tag-wrapper><div class=blog-date><time datetime=2022-07-31T13:40:00+08:00>Jul 31, 2022</time></div><div class=blog-tag>design</div></div></header><div class=blog-body><p>I just played this game called &lsquo;Stray&rsquo; over the week just to check out what all the hype was about.
Before I go on, I would like to say that it&rsquo;s a pretty decent game.
I can see why there are people who loved and hate it.
Here I&rsquo;m just going to pen down thoughts I find about the game.</p><p>Sorry about the word vomit in advance, and of course, spoilers from here on!</p></div><hr class=blog-list-content-seperator></article></div></div></div><footer>Powered By Hugo | v2.0 | Â© 2022 Gerald Wong</footer></body></html>
